## Enhancement Plan

### Artifact 1 - Software Design and Engineering
My first artifact comes from my previous coursework in Data structures and Algorithms and is my Lab 1-3 assignment. The initial purpose of this project was to demonstrate the usage of a struct in C++. Although the project comes from my Data structures and Algorithms course, I will be enhancing this project to illustrate my Software Engineering/Design abilities. My enhancement plan is to transfer the project from using C++ to Java. The main purpose of transferring this project between languages is to increase security of the program. Java does not contain the struct data structure, therefore I will have to convert the struct to a class to use within java. This change will increase the security of the data in the project since, by default, a struct is public, whereas a java class, by default, is private. Not only will the conversion of a struct to a class provide increased security, but it will also demonstrate an understanding of how object-oriented programming works in both languages. I will be changing the makeup of the project from one file to two .java files to further separate the created java class from the main functionality of the program and increase its modularity. User I/O differs between C++ and Java, so transferring this program one language to the other will show my ability to handle and secure user I/O functionality within a program. Each change to this program will be done with a security-first mindset as this will provide the basis for the other enhancements to build off.

### Artifact 2 - Algorithms and Data Structure

For my second enhancement, the artifact I will be using comes from my previous enhancement — the conversion of Lab 1-3 of my Data Structures and Algorithms course from C++ to Java — to demonstrate my knowledge of Algorithms and Data Structures. The enhancements that are planned are to implement an ArrayList, to store class data objects, and the implementation of a quicksort algorithm, allowing the user to sort the objects within the ArrayList. The implementation of the ArrayList will demonstrate my understanding of using a container to store multiple elements of a specific data type in java. The sorting algorithm will allow the user to sort the data in several ways, based upon the elements of each object. The implementation of the quicksort algorithm will demonstrate my ability to recursively traverse and sort a list of objects in an efficient way. The quicksort algorithm was chosen due to its complexity, O(n log n), which will scale well with the larger data sets that are expected for this program. This enhancement will continue to emphasize security and will be on display for user I/O when entering new class object data and menu options.

### Artifact 3 - Databases
For my third enhancement, the artifact that I will be using once again comes from my previous enhancement where I converted Lab 1-3 of my Data Structures and Algorithms course from C++ to Java. This enhancement will consist of implementing database functionality to store and manipulate data within the program. The database implementation plans to solve the issue of storing data in a central location rather than in a container within the running program. This implementation can prove beneficial if there are multiple instances of the program attempting to access the data. For my enhancement, I plan to utilize a MySQL database and the Java Database Connectivity, or JDBC, library to communicate with the MySQL database. Throughout the third enhancement, security remains paramount, and care will be taken to validate user input and protect against potential SQL injection attacks.
